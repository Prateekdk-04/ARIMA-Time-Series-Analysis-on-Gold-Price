# ARIMA-Time-Series-Analysis-on-Gold-Price
Developed an ARIMA-based time series model to analyze gold price trends, ensuring accuracy through statistical techniques and stationarity checks. Utilized the model for short- and long-term forecasting to support financial decision-making.

# Building an ARIMA Model for Gold Price Data:
 1.Data Collection: Gather a time series dataset of gold prices. Ensure that it's in chronological order.
 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to identify any trends, patterns, or seasonality. This step helps in determining the appropriate values   for p, d, and q.
 3.Model Evaluation:Describe the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's accuracy and performance.- Present the results of the model evaluation,
 including metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
 4.Discuss any limitations or assumptions of the ARIMA model and the potential impact on the results.
